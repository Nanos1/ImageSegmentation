My Thesis for the postgraduate MSc "***Machine Learning and Data Scince***": **Study of image segmentation models on different datasets**

The process of segmenting an image into different regions or objects is a critical step in computer vision and image analysis. In recent years, deep learning-based image segmentation models have demonstrated remarkable performance on various benchmark datasets. 

In this study, we have conducted a comprehensive analysis of several state-of-the-art image segmentation models on different benchmark datasets, including the Corsican Fire dataset. The models investigated in this thesis include DeepLabv3+, HRNet, HRNet+OCRNet, DDRNet, PIDNet, Swin Transformer, BASNet, BISNet, UNET3+, Attention U-Net, and EMANet. Each model has a unique architectural design and distinct features, which are tested on several benchmark datasets to evaluate their performance. The Corsican Fire dataset is a challenging dataset that consists of high-resolution images of forests captured during wildfire outbreaks. To test the model's robustness, we have also included other benchmark datasets, which are widely used in the field of image segmentation.
Our experimental results reveal that the ***Attention U-Net***, ***EMANet*** and ***Swin Transformer*** outperform the other models in terms of overall accuracy segmentation and speed on the Corsican fire dataset.

In addition, we performed an extensive comparative analysis of the models on other datasets and the results show that each model has its strengths and weaknesses depending on the characteristics of the dataset and the task segmentation task. Therefore, in the remainder of this study, it was shown that different models perform better in the transfer learning technique for its evaluation performance on other datasets. Overall, our study provides a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art image segmentation models on different benchmark datasets, highlighting their performance, strengths, and limitations. The findings of this study can serve as a benchmark for researchers in the field of computer vision and image analysis and can aid in the development of more efficient and accurate image segmentation models.
